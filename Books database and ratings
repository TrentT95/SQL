CREATE TABLE Books (id Integer Primary Key, name TEXT, rating INTEGER);
INSERT INTO Books Values (1, "Holes", 5);
INSERT INTO Books Values (2, "Hatchet", 4);
INSERT INTO Books Values (3, "Saw", 3)
This is my first project i have ever done using SQL
Line 1 is the command to creat a table called books which i will be using to rate some books i read in my early childhood.
Line 2 is the command to add holes to the first row on the table and rate it at 5.
Line 3 is the command to add hatchet to the table on row 2 and rate it at 4.
Line 4 is the command to add saw to the table on row 3 and rate it at 3.
I spent about 30 minutes doing this table, maybe that's not fast but it was my first time and i enjoyed learning it.
